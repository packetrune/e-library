ADLCore/Integrations, for the time being, will be a placeholder folder.

I don't see myself attempting to integrate ADLCore with accounts or sites for awhile yet, but there is a very real possibility that this will happen in the future.

One example of the potential usage of this would be watching your content through our own streaming functionality or player, which would allow for tracking and automatic updating of content consumed and progress on the integrated website.
